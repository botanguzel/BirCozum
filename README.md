## Introduction

This website has been built with HTML, PHP, JS, MySQL and Python for automation of certain functions. The point of this project is to create an online platform where residents of a small town (Seyrek) in Turkey can easily communicate with each other about the problems in their neighbourhood. The website uses Google MAPs API to show the position of the current complaints and suggestions.

## Complaints:

Users can see the suggestions and complaints of other users and the current status of that entry.

Here are a the categories of complaints and suggestions:

- Electricity outage
- Water outage
- Animal problems (Turkey has a lot of stray dogs and cats, they can be wild from time to time)
- Other problems

After creating an account users can choose to create an entry and when they are creating their entry they are being asked to enter the exact positionn of their problem together with the title and description. The users can later go into their profile to change the status of their entry to active or solved. However there is an admin account for the administrators to keep an eye over all of the entries to make sure the system is not being abused.

## Announcements:

Announcements gets current and future information about water and electricity the towns water and from the authorized websites and shows them on seperate tabs so the users can easily check what is going on or what has been planned for their town in the future. Announcements are automated and updated every day.

## Statistics

Statistics are there to show general information about what problems occur often and at which streets they occur. The main point behind the statistics is that so the people who wants to move to Seyrek, they can see and decide which street has less problems and decide accordingly.
